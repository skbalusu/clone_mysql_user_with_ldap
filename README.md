# clone_mysql_user_with_ldap
The clone_ldap_backed_mysql_user.sh script is a Bash script that allows you to clone an LDAP-backed MySQL user. It creates a new MySQL user based on an existing user, transfers the grants from the existing user to the new user, and records the cloning activity in the audit table.
